<h1>Changes to the third printing</h1>

<p>The third printing already incorporates changes listed later under
&quot;Changes to the first and second printing&quot;.</p>

<h3>Chapter 1</h3>

<p>Page 19 - Change first sentence to &quot;While it is too early ...&quot;</p>

<p>Page 25 - Last line in the 3rd bulletted item at the end of the page. Delete
&quot;the explore&quot;.</p>

<p>Page 32 - Figure 4-4A, there is a missing arrow pointing inward on the right
hand side (where the gap is in the line).</p>

<p>Page 37 - 5th paragraph, 7th line, 2nd word - delete &quot;more than&quot;.</p>

<p>Page 49 - Line 12 in the listing, change explicitely to explicitly.</p>

<h3>Chapter 5</h3>

<p>Page 59 - Figure 5-2. The arrow from Root should point to the outer

System.WinForms.Form object&quot; to &quot;The new form inherits from the
System.Windows.Forms.Form object&quot;</p>

<h3>Chapter 7</h3>

the Set, not the End statement (I have no idea how this typo got into the text -
the sample code is correct).</p>

parameter list.</p>

<p>Page 132 - Set term for the NumberOfKids property.&nbsp;</p>

file. Should begin &quot;This allows and application to specify that it <b>requires</b>
a specific&quot;</p>
<p>Page 525 - Third paragraph, should begin: &quot;For instance, you would never
want to grant unmanaged code permission to <b>execute</b> code
downloaded...&quot;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Changes to the second printing</h1>

<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<p>Page 21:Footnote #9<br>
<br>
                                            The Ebook referenced should be "Visual Basic.NET or C#:
Which to Choose", not the "Introduction to NT/2000 Security Programming with Visual Basic".</p>

<h1>Changes to the first printing</h1>
<p>The following changes and corrections apply to the first printing of the book
&quot;Moving to VB.NET: Strategies, Concepts and Code&quot;.</p>
<h3>Chapter 2</h3>
<p>On page 11, the bullet starting with &quot;The Forms Engine&quot;, at the end
of the first sentence add:</p>
<p>("Ruby" was the code name for the forms engine developed by Alan Cooper, that ultimately became the forms package for VB1).</p>
<h3>Chapter 4</h3>
<p>Change Footnote 4 to:</p>
<p>Purists will note that the CLR does, of
course, include methods intended to be used primarily by Visual Basic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Chapter 5</h3>
<p>Page 86, the section named &quot;Dealing with Naming Conflicts&quot;, 2nd
paragraph, last sentence.</p>
<p>&quot;The Namespace defines two interfaces&quot; should be &quot;The example
defines two interfaces&quot;</p>
<p>Page 90, final line in the page, change &quot;Systems.Winforms&quot; with
&quot;System.Windows.Form&quot;.</p>
<p>Page 91, add the following at the end of the first sentence:</p>
<p>(for now, think of a namespace can be thought of as a way to logically group classes).</p>
<h3>Chapter 8</h3>
<p>This is not so much a change as an addition. Visual Basic.NET includes
support for both multidimensional arrays and jagged arrays (which are not
mentioned in the chapter).</p>
<p>It also includes a rather poorly documented alternate syntax for dynamically
creating arrays which can then be assigned to existing array variables or passed
as parameters to methods expecting arrays as parameters. Specifically, both of
the lines shown below create an integer array initialized to {1, 2, 3}. The
first one declares the variable. The second line creates a new array and assigns
it to an existing variable.</p>

</font>
<p>Refer to the sample code in the Source\Additions\MoreArrays directory for
example code demonstrating this feature and both multidimensional and jagged
arrays. </p>
<h3>Chapter 15</h3>

<h3>Page 457</h3>

<p>In listing 15.1 change</p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">Dim ComObject As New dwComFromDotNet_8_0.SampleClass1()</font></pre>

<p>to:</p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">Dim ComObject As New dwComFromDotNet.SampleClass1</font></pre>

<p>This reflects a last minute change to beta 2. Also, add the line</p>

<pre><font face="Courier New" size="2">newThread.Join()</font></pre>
<p>before the Console.ReadLine() statement in the Main function. This makes sure
the message from the other thread can be viewed when the program is run.</p>

<h3>Other Notes</h3>

<p>Interop seems to be less stable than other parts of beta 2. You may see
Visual Studio crash occasionally when testing the Interop examples. These
reflect problems in Visual Studio - not the examples. Be sure to allow Visual
Studio to send error information to Microsoft when this occurs to help them
resolve these problems.</p>

<h3>Chapter 16</h3>

<p>Few things are more frustrating for an author than when something works fine
in an intermediate build, but fails during the released beta. Here I am in the
unusual situation where the code in the book is correct, yet fails compilation
with a message &quot;catastrophic error - unable to emit code&quot;.</p>

<p>It seems that declarative security in beta 2 of VB.NET is broken -
specifically, you can't use the SecurityPermission attribute. I'm fairly sure
it's a compiler bug, partly because it worked with an earlier build, and partly
because the C# equivalent code works fine. I'll be contacting Microsoft for
further information and will post updates when I can. Meanwhile, the sample code
has been modified to use imperative security. The changes are noted in the code.
(Note: this is based on tests on a clean Windows 2000 pro build).</p>

<h3>Page 527</h3>

<p>The mmc snap-in now no longer prompts you to check the &quot;Exclusive&quot;
check box. Instead, you are prompted to right click to view the properties of
the newly added code group, select the general tab, and check the checkbox
labeled &quot;This policy level will only have the permissions from the permission set associated with this code group&quot;.</p>

<p>Note that in beta 2, you may have trouble using the mmc snap-in - I've been
seeing a variety of errors (win2k pro). You can use the caspol.exe application
to set security as well. Refer to the .NET tools documentation for information
on caspol. You can see four batch files in the source\ch16\CallsUnmanaged2
directory labeled cas1.bat, cas2.bat, cas3.bat and cas4.bat that I used to
manually set the code groups for this example. You will need to modify these
batch files depending on where files are loaded on your system if you wish to
use them. You should also use the cas1.bat batch file to verify the number of
the All-Code group before you try to run the other code groups. Take the time to
read the documentation so you know what you are doing before you use these batch
files, because incorrect use can make the .NET framework unusable on your
system.</p>
